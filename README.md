# FreeCodeCamp Projects

This repository contains a collection of projects I completed as part of the [FreeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/) curriculum. Each project was built to meet specific requirements outlined in the course, but I implemented them myself to ensure I fully understood the concepts and applied them effectively.

## About the Projects

The projects in this repository cover a variety of topics and skills in **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript**. Each project was designed to teach me specific web development concepts, ranging from basic structure and styling to interactivity and responsive design.

### Skills Gained

Through these projects, I gained hands-on experience with the following:
- **HTML**: Semantic structure, forms, tables, and accessibility best practices.
- **CSS**: Styling, layout techniques (flexbox, grid), responsive design, and animations.
- **JavaScript** (Coming Soon): Adding interactivity, manipulating the DOM, and handling events.
- **Problem-Solving**: Breaking down project requirements and implementing solutions step by step.
- **Version Control**: Using Git and GitHub to manage and track my progress.

### How to View the Projects

Each project is stored in its own folder within this repository. To view a project:
1. Navigate to the corresponding folder.
2. Open the `index.html` file in your browser.

### Acknowledgments

These projects were inspired by the FreeCodeCamp curriculum, but all the code and implementation were done by me to meet the requirements. I am grateful to FreeCodeCamp for providing such a comprehensive learning platform.
