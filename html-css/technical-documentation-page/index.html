            <header>HTML: HyperText Markup Language</header>
            <p>HTML (HyperText Markup Language) is the most basic building block of the Web. It defines the meaning and structure of web content. Other technologies besides HTML are generally used to describe a web page's appearance/presentation (CSS) or functionality/behavior (JavaScript).</p>
            <p>"Hypertext" refers to links that connect web pages to one another, either within a single website or between websites. Links are a fundamental aspect of the Web. By uploading content to the Internet and linking it to pages created by other people, you become an active participant in the World Wide Web.</p>
            <p>HTML uses "markup" to annotate text, images, and other content for display in a Web browser. HTML markup includes special "elements" such as <code>&lthead&gt, &lttitle&gt, &ltbody&gt</code> and many others.</p>

        <section class="main-section" id="css">
            <header>CSS: Cascading Style Sheets</header>
            <p>Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) is a stylesheet language used to describe the presentation of a document written in HTML or XML (including XML dialects such as SVG, MathML or XHTML). CSS describes how elements should be rendered on screen, on paper, in speech, or on other media.</p>
            <p>CSS is among the core languages of the open web and is standardized across Web browsers according to W3C specifications. Previously, the development of various parts of CSS specification was done synchronously, which allowed the versioning of the latest recommendations. You might have heard about CSS1, CSS2.1, or even CSS3. There will never be a CSS3 or a CSS4; rather, everything is now just "CSS" with individual CSS modules having version numbers.</p>
            <p>After CSS 2.1, the scope of the specification increased significantly and the progress on different CSS modules started to differ so much, that it became more effective to develop and release recommendations separately per module. Instead of versioning the CSS specification, W3C now periodically takes a snapshot of the latest stable state of the CSS specification and individual modules progress. CSS modules now have version numbers, or levels, such as CSS Color Module Level 5.</p>

            <header>JavaScript</header>
            <p>JavaScript (JS) is a lightweight interpreted (or just-in-time compiled) programming language with first-class functions. While it is most well-known as the scripting language for Web pages, many non-browser environments also use it, such as Node.js, Apache CouchDB and Adobe Acrobat. JavaScript is a prototype-based, multi-paradigm, single-threaded, dynamic language, supporting object-oriented, imperative, and declarative (e.g. functional programming) styles.</p>
            <p>JavaScript's dynamic capabilities include runtime object construction, variable parameter lists, function variables, dynamic script creation (via <code>eval</code>), object introspection (via <code>for...in</code> and <code>Object</code> utilities), and source-code recovery (JavaScript functions store their source text and can be retrieved through <code>toString()</code>).</p>

            <header>HTTP</header>
            <p>Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) is an application-layer protocol for transmitting hypermedia documents, such as HTML. It was designed for communication between web browsers and web servers, but it can also be used for other purposes, such as machine-to-machine communication, programmatic access to APIs, and more.</p>
            <p>HTTP follows a classical client-server model, with a client opening a connection to make a request, then waiting until it receives a response from the server. HTTP is a stateless protocol, meaning that the server does not keep any session data between two requests, although the later addition of cookies adds state to some client-server interactions.</p>

            <p>When writing code for the Web, there are a large number of Web APIs available. Below is a list of all the APIs and interfaces (object types) that you may be able to use while developing your Web app or site.</p>
            <p>Web APIs are typically used with JavaScript, although this doesn't always have to be the case.</p>
